# Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset

This repository contains a **lecture-style Jupyter Notebook** that walks through a complete machine learning workflow using **logistic regression** on the classic Titanic dataset.  
It is designed for teaching purposes, with explanations and code that illustrate the reasoning behind each step.

## Concepts Covered

- **Problem framing and dataset overview**  
  Understanding the task of survival prediction.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Inspecting data types, distributions, and missing values.

- **Data cleaning and feature engineering**  
  Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and preparing inputs.

- **Train/Test Split & Baseline Model**  
  Building the foundation for fair evaluation.

- **Feature Selection (RFE)**  
  Identifying the most important predictors.

- **Logistic Regression Model**  
  Fitting, interpreting coefficients, and understanding probabilities.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Accuracy and classification report  
  - Cross-validation  
  - Confusion matrices  
  - ROC curves and decision thresholds

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the notebook `Lecture.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
3. Run the cells in order to follow along with the explanations.
