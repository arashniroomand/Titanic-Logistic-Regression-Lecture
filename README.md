# Titanic Logistic Regression Lecture

This repository is designed as a **teaching project** for beginners in machine learning. When I started learning, I often searched for practical, step-by-step projects that explained not only the code but also the reasoning behind each step. This notebook is written with that purpose in mind.

## What you will learn

1. **Data exploration:** How to look at raw data and ask the right questions.  
2. **Feature selection:** Which features to keep, which to drop, and why this matters.  
3. **Data preprocessing:** Handling categorical values, missing data, and preparing features.  
4. **Logistic regression basics:** Understanding how the model works and applying it to a real dataset.  
5. **Model evaluation:** Checking accuracy and interpreting results.  

## Why Titanic dataset?

The Titanic dataset is simple yet powerful for illustrating classification tasks. It allows us to focus on **how to think about the data** while practicing core ML techniques.

## Audience

This repo is for **beginners** who want a clear, hands-on project rather than abstract theory. It is written in a teaching style, with explanations alongside the code.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the notebook `Lecture.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
3. Run the cells in order to follow along with the explanations.

## Learning Goal

By the end of the notebook, you will be able to:
- Apply logistic regression to a real dataset,
- Perform essential data preparation steps,
- Evaluate classification models with multiple metrics,
- Understand trade-offs using ROC curves and thresholds.
